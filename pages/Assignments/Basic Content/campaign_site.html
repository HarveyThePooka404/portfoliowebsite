        <h1>Goal</h1>
        <p> Create a campaign site for Food Sharing Copenhagen to either promote volunteering or raise awareness on food wasting. The campaign site had to contain a video.</p>

    <div class="assignment" id="third-assignment">
        <h1>Process</h1>
        <p>For this project, it was harder to divide the tasks among us. We worked as a group on the video from the storyboard to filming. I did the editing by myself, while others were working on the website and pitch.

            <div class="assignment" id="fifth-assignment">
        <h1>What worked well </h1>
        <p> We had a video that was funny and a story, which we were the only ones to propose to the client. We were ready to work on an actual campaign centered around the #LittleHeartbreaks - which would have been easily usable in contests, posts and other social media declinaison. </p>

        <h1>What could have been improved </h1>
       <p>The video might have been too complicated to do for our team. We did not have anyone with a training on filming and directing and it was complicated for me to be both acting and overlooking what was done. We should have been closer to our story and not try to promote the point-of-view of a salad. </p>
