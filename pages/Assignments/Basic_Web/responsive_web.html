        <h1>Goal</h1>
        <p>We were to make our website, made for our give art style, responsive. The changes were meant to be only technical, while not changing the content of the website.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="assignment" id="second-assignment">
        <div class="titre"><br>This is the home page</div><img src="../../../assets/img/web_dev/web_dev_img.png" alt="Home page">
    </div>

        <div class="assignment" id="third-assignment">
        <h1>Process</h1>
        <p>The responsive website you will see was the second version made this semester. The current version of Owldesign.dk (v2) was made during the re-design for “02.03.01 Design, UX and process document”. The first wireframe show that the first version was too vertical, and was not responsive enough. After re-doing the wireframe, I decided to do a high-fidelity prototype on XD. It helped me to follow a clearer and more strict structure. Working with XD offered a better example of what was working. </p>
    </div>

        <div class="assignment" id="fourth-assignment">
        <div class="titre"><br>These are the wireframes</div>

            <img class="wireframe" id="wireframe2" src="../../../assets/img/responsive_website/wireframe_v2.jpg" alt="second wireframe">
    </div>

            <div class="assignment" id="fifth-assignment">
        <h1>What worked well </h1>
        <p>Through the whole process, it became clear for me that planning and having a precise idea of the final website would look like was best. I do believe that the simpler the design, the best the website. It was harder to have a smooth, uncrowded version of the website.</p>

        <p>The use of breakpoints for the website gave a smoother, better browsing. The user would have had three different experiences for the website, specifically thought for the devices they are on.

        <h1>What could have been improved </h1>
       <p>To do the carrousels, I had to use some Javascript - which we had not learn at the time. I lost a lot of time trying to understand everything in the code, while I could have done something similar (or better) in vanilla Html/CSS. It would have been probably better to use Keyframe animation.</p>
