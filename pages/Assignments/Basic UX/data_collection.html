        <h1>Goal</h1>
        <p> Understanding how to collect and analyze data, through three different approaches: desk research, field observation, survey and interviews.</p>

        <h1>Process</h1>
        <p>For the desk research, I studied the use of VR to help people with dementia. I would not have been possible to explore the subject in depth, but it was meant to have a general idea of what is happening at the time. For dementia and VR, it was important to see that there are several uses of VR (that could be explored further in the future) - training medical help, fighting social loneliness in patients, training patients on daily tasks. A quick Google search with precise key words was enough to explore the topic.</p>

        <p>For the field observation, I look at waiting queues at two ramen restaurants in Copenhagen. The difference in experiences was linked to both the price (and standing) and the location. Slurp is a city-center, more expensive restaurant, when Ramen to Biiru is a franchise, in Vesterbro. Through pictures and observing, I could understand the importance of the waiting experience in a restaurant.</p>

        <p>For the survey, we asked other international students questions on their arrival in Copenhagen. Through 5 questions, we were meant to identify a concern they might have. </p>

        <p> For the interview, I interviewed my partner on her climbing experience. I have been climbing with her for the last 5 years, so the challenge was to push the interview further than just superficial questions. It was important to have both an interview that anyone could read and understand but that would be interesting for us to do.

            <div class="assignment" id="fifth-assignment">
        <h1>What worked well </h1>
        <p> I had done desk research (which I would link to the practice of benchmarks in corporate environment) and interviews (as a head-hunter) in my previous positions. I felt comfortable in doing it again. </p>

                <div class="assignment" id="seventh-assignment">
        <h1>What could have been improved </h1>
       <p>On the other hand, the observation was a completely new process to me. I feel that I did not have enough hard data. It would have been interested to do the 4 methods on the same topic to see if the problems we identified in one were also mentioned in others.</p> 

<p>There is also problems in the presentation of the data. The file is hard to read, with both a lot of text, and not an intelligent use of pictures and data. Working through a more “presentation” model would have been better.
