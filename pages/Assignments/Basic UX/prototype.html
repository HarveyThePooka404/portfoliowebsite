        <h1>Goal</h1>
        <p> In teams of two, we were to create a high fidelity prototype for a website. The website was supposed to be for the Ministry of Higher Education in Denmark, to help new students arriving in Denmark to find: a date, an accommodation or a student job.</p>

    <div class="assignment" id="third-assignment">
        <h1>Process</h1>
        <p> With Daniel, we worked on a benchmark on different existing websites and applications for the aforementioned needs. We did a first quick wireframe and lo-fi of the website, and tested it on students. We finished with a high-fidelity website, made on XD.</p>

            <div class="assignment" id="fifth-assignment">
        <h1>What worked well </h1>
        <p>The benchmark on Accommodation finding websites helped to have an expected flow of the website. Going through from page to page felt natural, and made sense for the users. Using the exact color scheme, footer and design from the Ministry helped give a “professional” feel to the website.</p>

<p> The benchmark on social media and international students (which led me to discover Hootsuite) helped me on later projects.

        <h1>What could have been improved </h1>
       <p>The copy and micro-copy were not targeted enough. The website would have worked better as an app. The website felt too simple in general, and would have been somehow hard to code. While working on the prototype, it was easy to see what the focus of the website was: how to get the user to contact a landlord. But it was harder to was a fluid design with it.
