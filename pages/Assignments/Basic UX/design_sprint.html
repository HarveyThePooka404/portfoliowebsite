        <h1>Goal</h1>
        <p> Through the design sprint, we were to create a prototype for a native app helping the students of KEA. It was meant to help us both learn about the process of a design sprint, and working on a prototype as a bigger group. .</p>

    <div class="assignment" id="third-assignment">
        <h1>Process</h1>
        <p> The process was structured by the Google method of design sprints (map, sketch, decide, prototype, pitch). We worked 5 days in a row on the same prototype. As a group we decided to work on a Skill swapping app. Any student could offer a skill to teach and find someone to teach them a skill they want to learn. The second day was very important: we went through the storyboard and sketching, which helped us get on the same page as a group. For the rest of the project, we worked on specific tasks. I worked with Simon on the high fidelity prototype. The application was pitched in front of the class on the last day. </p>

        <h1>What worked well </h1>
<p>We used “Simon” from our group as an example during the storyboard/sketching part of the script. Doing a storyboard before a sketch was a new concept and worked really well to make sense of the experience the user would have. Since then, I have used it on two different projects outside of KEA, and it helps people to think outside of the design and features, and focus on why would someone use their app/website/product… </p>

<p>We succeeded in both creating a common vision at the beginning and working very independently in the end.</p>

        <h1>What could have been improved </h1>
       <p>We followed the KEA color scheme for the app, which we could have avoided and worked with a stronger design of our own.</p>

<p>The voting process was long and tedious, as we didn’t all focus on the same part of the app: it could have been interesting (and more efficient) to split the tasks earlier in the process, to have a more in-depth result in each.</p>

<p>During the pitch, we insisted on the features and concept more than showing the actual design. The other groups had live demonstration of the prototype, which we did not. </p>
