    <div class="assignment" id="first-assignment">
        <h1>Goal</h1>
        <p> Choosing in a pool of ten projects, we had in teams of two to make a JS animation.
</p>
    </div>

    <div class="assignment" id="second-assignment">
        <div class="titre"><br>This is a burger menu expanded</div><img src="../../../assets/img/basic_animation/burgermenu_img.jpg">
    </div>

    <div class="assignment" id="third-assignment">
        <h1>Process</h1>
        <p> I made a “drum machine” with Esther, and a “Burger Menu” with Zuzana.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="assignment" id="fourth-assignment">
        <div class="titre"><br>This is a drum machine</div><img src="../../../assets/img/basic_animation/drummachine_esther_img.jpg">
    </div>

            <div class="assignment" id="fifth-assignment">
        <h1>What worked well </h1>
        <p> For the projects, there was mostly one technical question to be answered. For the drum machine, it was to be able to replay the sound quickly, which can be achieved by starting the sound at 0 within the JS code. For the burger menu, we tried to have it expand from a circle form.</p>

<p> It tried to re-do a drum machine after the assignment. I felt that the arrows and information were too much on the screen. I wanted a more artistic experience for the users, so they would try themselves to see how it works.
</p>

    </div>

            <div class="assignment" id="sixth-assignment">
        <div class="titre"><br>These are some examples of the projects</div><img src="../../../assets/img/basic_animation/pool_examples_img.png">
    </div>

                <div class="assignment" id="seventh-assignment">
        <h1>What could have been improved </h1>
       <p> I am not happy with the burger menu we did. While the animation is interesting - the visual of the retracted menu feels wobbly, and isn’t properly centered. The circle is too large and feels very aggressive on the page. It could not be used on an actual web page. We also didn’t take into account where the different links would appear. We would have to account for the links in the “expanded” state and make them not visible in the “retracted” state.
