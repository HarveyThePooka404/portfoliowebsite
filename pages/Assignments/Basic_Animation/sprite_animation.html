    <!-- page specific content -->

    <div class="assignment" id="first-assignment">
        <h1>Goal</h1>
        <p> The assignment was to create a sprite animation (animated with CSS), on a SVG background.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="assignment" id="second-assignment">
        <div class="titre"><br>This is an example of the first sketches</div><img src="../../../assets/img/basic_animation/sketches_img.jpg" alt="First Sketches">
    </div>

    <div class="assignment" id="third-assignment">
        <h1>Process</h1>
        <p>The creation of the animation started with a moodboard and characters design. I choose to do two animals (a raccoon and an owl) - which helped for the design of the “Onboarding” project. We then had to create a background, linked to the story. Finally, we linked everything together in the sprite animation.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="assignment" id="fourth-assignment">
        <div class="titre"><br>This is the face done with Illustrator</div><img src="../../../assets/img/basic_animation/face_animation_img.jpg" alt="Cooney Faces">
    </div>

            <div class="assignment" id="fifth-assignment">
        <h1>What worked well </h1>
        <p> It was a great exercice to learn Illustrator. I was able to reflect what I wanted to express from the sketches to the final Illustrator design. </p>

    </div>

            <div class="assignment" id="sixth-assignment">
        <div class="titre"><br>This is the complete set-up</div><img src="../../../assets/img/basic_animation/complete_img.jpg" alt="Final Sprite Animation">
    </div>

                <div class="assignment" id="seventh-assignment">
        <h1>What could have been improved </h1>
       <p>I am still not happy with the final design. I was too focused on the technical approach to the project, which led me to overcomplicated the design. I should have done something, in terms of graphic design, a lot simpler, based on my stronger skills of coding. I should have improved on designs that I already know and enjoy (pixel art for example), and not try to push in new territories.</p>

<p>There is also some technical problems on the background that should have been made as a SVG, and not a jpg, to ensure scaling properly.
